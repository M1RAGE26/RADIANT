Although navigation apps are now necessary for commuting, they still mainly rely on human input, which can be dangerous and cumbersome, particularly when riding a bicycle, walking, or driving in an unknown place. Conventional GPS applications use voice guidance or static 2D maps to give instructions, but they don't offer hands-free operation or real-world immersion. Furthermore, some apps do not support dynamic route alterations, such adding stops or rerouting while on the move, even though they do support simple voice commands. For a more user-friendly and engaging experience, current navigation systems also fall short of utilizing AR technology to its full potential. Furthermore, users find it more difficult to avoid crowded locations or police checks because traffic and road hazard updates are sometimes delayed or exclude important real-time data. This prompted me to find a suitable remedy so that everyone may drive on the roads in comfort. Doing a survey of potential consumers that leads to an interview is the best way to determine the requirements for my project. My approach to creating the interview was straightforward: I wanted the user's opinion on the application's dependability and usefulness.
